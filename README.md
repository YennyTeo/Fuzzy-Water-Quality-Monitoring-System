# **_Fuzzy Water Quality Monitoring System Using Fuzzy Logic_**
The proposed Fuzzy Water Quality Monitoring system for Malaysia, in alignment with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), seeks to achieve several critical objectives. Firstly, it aims to ensure universal access to clean and safe drinking water, mitigating the risk of waterborne diseases and promoting public health. Secondly, it focuses on protecting aquatic life, preserving ecosystems, and conserving freshwater resources through diligent water quality monitoring. Additionally, the system assists water authorities and providers in adhering to stringent water quality standards, guaranteeing the delivery of high-quality drinking water. Finally, it places a strong emphasis on sustainable water resource management, addressing the challenges of water scarcity, pollution, and overexploitation. Through real-time monitoring, data analysis, and adaptive decision-making, this system aims to enhance and sustain the quality of drinking water in Malaysia while contributing to broader global efforts for clean and safe water access.
